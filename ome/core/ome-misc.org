* Rainbow Delimiters
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: rainbow-delimiters
  :END:

"RainbowDelimiters is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which highlights
parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each successive
level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy to spot matching
delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a
given depth."
